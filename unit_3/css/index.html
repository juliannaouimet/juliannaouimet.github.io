	<h3> <div id="slogan"></div>Cookies so good, they don't have to be a guilty pleasure.</h3>

	<p>We did the work, so you can do the eating. Our vegan cookie dough is sweeten with organic maple syrup, loaded with chocolate chips, and a touch of coarse sea salt for an irresistibly salty-sweet guilt-free treat.</p>
